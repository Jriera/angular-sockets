# angular-sockets
This shows how to connect angular at the front and nodejs sockets at the back
It behaves like a chat application where messages are sent to the server and the server broadcasts them to all the connected clients
in order to run it you need to start the server via `node index.js` in the server folder and `ng serve`in the client folder
